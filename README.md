## WAM Calc

For some reason, USYD doesn't show you your overall WAM in Sydney Student. 

This repository will read in a transcript from ```transcript/sample.pdf```, parse in the marks, credit points and calculate your WAM (Weighted Average Mark).


#### To Do / Possible Features
- Implement PDF parsing
- Implement front end
- Add in analytics (WAM by year, by session, by major, level)
- Convert to US 4.0 GPA equivalent
